# Improving Ticketing Systems: A Guide for UpCommerce SRE Team

## Introduction
Hey Team,
During our recent stand-up, we discussed some major pain points with our ticketing system, especially around dealing with recurring alerts and lacking clear priorities. Here are a couple of solutions we're considering to make our lives easier.

## Solutions

### 1. Smarter Alert Management and Automation

#### What's the Deal:
Let's make our ticketing system work smarter, not harder. We can implement tools that:
- **Smartly Sort Alerts**: Use tools that can learn from past incidents to prioritize incoming alerts based on their severity and relevance.
- **Automatic Ticket Routing**: Have the system automatically assign tickets to the right folks based on their expertise and workload.
- **Dynamic Priority**: Adjust ticket priority on-the-fly depending on factors like customer impact and SLAs.

#### Why It Matters:
- Less manual work for us, more time for solving real problems.
- Faster response times mean happier customers and a more reliable system overall.

#### Tools to Check Out:
- **PagerDuty**: Solid choice for incident response and automation.
- **OpsGenie**: Great for managing alerts and automating responses.
- **ServiceNow**: Comprehensive IT service management platform with AI-powered features.

### 2. Learning from Incidents and Continuous Improvement

#### What's the Plan:
Let's create a culture of learning and improvement within our team:
- **Post-Incident Reviews (PIRs)**: Dive deep into incidents to understand what went wrong and how we can avoid it next time.
- **Feedback Channels**: Encourage everyone to share their thoughts on how we can improve our ticketing process.
- **Continuous Refinement**: Use what we learn to keep tweaking and improving how we handle tickets.

#### Why It's Important:
- We get better every time something goes wrong, preventing future headaches.
- Collaboration and ownership lead to a smoother workflow and a happier team.

#### Tools to Consider:
- **Jira**: Great for tracking issues and managing projects, with built-in tools for reviews and feedback.
- **GitHub Issues**: Simple and effective for tracking bugs and suggestions.
- **Slack Integration**: Keep the conversation going in our favorite communication tool.

## Wrapping Up
By implementing these solutions, we can tackle the toil in our ticketing system head-on, making our work more efficient and enjoyable for everyone involved.

Let's do this!
